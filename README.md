# WRITE-XL

Write-XL is a set of plugins that operates overtop of lite-xl. It's designed to make the text editor more appealing to use for writing and reading fiction, in markdown.

## Features

* A more word-like **color** scheme.
* An automatic configuration of line wrapping and document setup to be more word-like.
* Keybinds for standard stuff like bolding, italicizing, and underlining (`ctrl`+`b`, `ctrl`+`i`, `ctrl`+`u`).

## TODO

* Add in a spellchecker that works with markdown.
* Speed up the opening of large documents.
* Jump to Chapter
* Automatic Chapter Summaries
* Side-by-Side Outline Reading
* Using `git` as a track changes method (because, let's be real, track changes is shit, normally; and `git` is one of the most used softwares on the planet).
* A plugin to detect whether you're overusing a particular phrase.
* Character Registry, with Minimap
* Word Count
* Other Document Metrics

## Install
 
To install, simply drop the `user` folder next to your `lite-xl` executable, or, set your `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable to this repository's directory.
